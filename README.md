# WebPackage
WebPackage is a *revolutionary* new way of distributing web apps on any platform. It works by packaging the web app in a `.webpkg` file, a special kind of zip file designed for distributing web apps. 
## Use Cases
* In third-world countries, web apps and games can be distributed P2P and run in any app that reads these packages
## WebPackage vs. PWA
* put something here
## Structure
The structure of a `.webpkg` contains two folders, a `app` folder and a `meta` folder. The `app` folder is where you store all of the code, such as html, css, and javascript files. The `meta` folder is where you store screenshots, an icon and a `meta.json` file.
